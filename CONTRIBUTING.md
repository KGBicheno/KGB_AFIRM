## Contributions are welcome
While I welcome people adding their time and effort to the project, I would expect everyone involved to have a clear idea of the project's goals.

I'm fond of making use of all the online tools at our disposal and would expect at least lurking in our Discord channel and at least one interaction on Github. 

I will review all code for security holes and maliciious script but I hope to vet those who would attempt such things during an initial chat. 

While simply asking to be involved is sufficient, tackling a problem in the code through a fork is a giant plus towards your name. 

All code and changes remain the property of the project of itsef in accordance with the licence.
