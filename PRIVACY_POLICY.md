The Privacy Act 1988 requires us to have a privacy policy.

Our Privacy Policy outlines what kinds of personal and sensitive information we collect, why we collect this information, and how we handle it.

Personal information is information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.

Sensitive information is a subset of personal information and includes information or an opinion about your:

    racial or ethnic origin
    political opinions
    religious beliefs or affiliations
    philosophical beliefs
    sexual orientation
    criminal record
    health information
    genetic information.

## What we collect

We may collect personal information about you when it’s reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, our functions or activities. We may collect sensitive information about you where you consent, when the collection is authorised or required by law, or the collection is otherwise allowed under the Privacy Act.

The kinds of personal information we may collect includes all of the following.

Information about you, such as your:

    Twitter handle

Information about your circumstances, such as your:

    Number of followers
    Number of Retweets
    Number of Likes

Information about your interactions with us, such as:

    Tweets or mentions between our accounts
    Direct messages between our accounts
    Tweets or Retweets where both our accounts are mentioned

We may also collect information that is volunteered:

    In tweets linking to pages you visit
    In the contents of public tweets or retweets

## How we collect information

We collect your personal information through legitimate use of the Twitter API.

We may also collect your personal information from obtaining the contents of public websites you have linked in a tweet or retweet:

    Using automated code
    Using the Twitter API

Twitter is the only Third Party we authorise to handle your personal information as we use its API to interact with you with your consent.

## Data matching

We do not data match. We anonymise all data before any anlysis begins. Your personal information such that your identity could be matched with our analysis is deleted by automated systems before moving to servers where analysis takes place.

We do not share your personal information to conduct statistical analysis and market research. We do not engage external companies to conduct research on our behalf.

## Disclosure of information to third parties

### Other social networking services

We use social networking services such as Discord, Slack, Instagram and Telegram to talk with the public and our staff. When you talk with us using these services we may collect your personal information to communicate with you and the public.

The social networking service will also handle your personal information for its own purposes. These services have their own privacy policies. You can access the privacy policies for these services on their websites.

### Government and legal obligations

We may disclose your information to Australian Government agencies, state and territory agencies and third parties. The disclosure of your personal information will depend on the timing of any lawful request for data made, as identifying data is, by policy, stored no longer than 60 minutes before destruction if at all.

### To help our community in a time of emergency or disaster

In some circumstances, we may share information to support people who have been affected by a disaster or emergency. This could include sharing information with agencies and organisations as part of the emergency response or recovery effort. We may, for example, share information to help affected individuals to access financial or other assistance from charities, as well as from Australian government agencies.

## How we store personal information

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

These steps include:

    storing paper records securely as per Australian government security guidelines (pro-forma, we abhor arborial databases)
    only accessing personal information on a need-to-know basis and by authorised personnel
    monitoring system access which can only be accessed by authenticated credentials
    ensuring our buildings are secure
    regularly updating and auditing our storage and data security systems.

When no longer required, we destroy or archive personal information in a secure manner.

## Secrecy

In addition, our contributors are bound by secrecy provisions that regulate information we collect for social security, family assistance, health, child support and redress law. These secrecy provisions restrict the access, use and communication of protected information, including within the department.

## How we share information outside Australia

We may disclose your personal information overseas, such as to a foreign government or agency, where:

    The disclosure is required or authorised by law, or
    International information sharing arrangements are in place.
    Because a social media company made a dodgy deal with a government

## How to access and correct information about you

You have the right to both ask:

    For access to personal information that we hold about you
    That we correct personal information we hold about you.

If you ask, we must give you access to your personal information, and take reasonable steps to correct it if we consider it is incorrect, unless there is a law that allows or requires us not to.

We will notify you in writing, and explain our reasons if we refuse to give you access to, or correct, your personal information.

You can access and correct most of your details online using self service. If you can’t use self service, read more about access to information or contact us.

It’s important to tell us if your circumstances change to ensure you are only accessing payments and services you are eligible for.

- sending an [email to pencoded@gmail.com](mailto:pencoded@gmail.com?subject=AFIRM_privacy_issue)

We will always respond to your feedback.
